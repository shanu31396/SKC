    What is OOPs?
    It is an approach to make our programs better by eliminating the pitfall of conventional  programming methods, like to make bug free programs
   
   
    WHY OOPS?
    C++ language was designed with the main intention of adding object-oriented features to C language.
    As the size of program increases, readability, maintainability and bug-free nature of program decreases.
    This was the major problem with the languages like C which relied upon functions or procedures (hence, named procedural oriented programming language)
    As a result, the possibility of  not addressing the problem in an effective manner was high.
    Also, as data was almost neglected, data security was easily compromised.
    Using classes solves this problem by modelling program as a real world scenario.

   
    // PROCEDURAL ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
    Main focus is on function not on flow of data
    Functions can either use local or global data
    Data moves openly from function to function

    
    // OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
    Works on the concept of classes and objects
    Treats data as a critical element
    **************************************Decomposes the problem in OBJECTS and builds data and function around OBJECTS **************************************

    Classes are just like templates and they don't consume memory but when we make objects from class(i.e. template) it takes memory 
    according to variables defined in that class


    // BASIC TERMINOLOGY USED IN OOPs
    Classes:-   basic template for creating objects 
    Object:-    basic run time entities
    (Data abstraction) & (Encapsulation):-  (Wrapping data and functions) into (single unit)
    Inheritance:-   Properties of one class can be inherited into others
    Polymorphism:-  ability to take more than one form
    Dynamic Binding:-   code which will execute is not known until the program runs
    Message Passing:-   Object.messge(Information) call format


    // BENEFITS OF OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
    Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
    Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
    Multiple objects can co-exist without any interference
    Software complexity can be managed easily
